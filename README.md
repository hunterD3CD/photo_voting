## Concept:

The Photo Voting application is used for groups of friends who would like to vote their group photos before sharing with public. Once users are reistered and log in, they would be able to upload the photos and see the votes from their friends. And user can see all the photos tagged in and vote on their favorite photos to upload to another platform.

Challenges:
